# jest-react-testing-2

>Example app built with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for integration and snapshot testing.

The project is already set up with all packages to test react components: [**`enzyme`**](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/), `enzyme-adapter-react-16`, `react-test-renderer` and `enzyme-to-json` for snapshot testing. You can read more about setting it up here: [**Running test @ create-react-app**](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#running-tests)


## Installation

_with npm_
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FEND16/jest-react-testing.git
cd jest-react-testing
npm install
```
_with yarn_
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FEND16/jest-react-testing.git
cd jest-react-testing
yarn
```

## Running tests

Project has a few test already that are mostly integration tests and [`snapshot`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html) tests. All tests should pass when you run the test command.

```bash
yarn test
```
```bash
npm test
```

### With coverage

```bash
yarn test --coverage
```

```bash
npm run test -- --coverage
```

## ESLint

Running ESLint

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/eslint
```

Running from global eslint

If you want `.eslintrc` to be detected by your editor you need to install plugin/extensions for your editor.

## Exercise

1. **Reach 100% code coverage!**
2. Upload your solution as a branch with your name to this repository. You should have push-rights to it.
3. Compare with a friend how you did to reach full coverage. How many tests where run? Did you test all important functionality? Where you able to reach high coverage without testing certain functions? What parts of the code did you expect to test but didn't have to?
